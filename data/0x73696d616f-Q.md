## [L - 01]  [`execute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital/blob/main/contracts/hook/MoneyMarketHook.sol#L53) could check leftover balances in all interacted tokens.
Users could make mistakes and tokens beside `ETH` could be left in the contract. The refund mechanism could be extended to other tokens as well.

## [L - 02] reserveFactor in LendingPool should be capped at 1e18
[`setReserveFactor()_e18`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital/blob/main/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L239-L241) does not check the reserveFactor, which if bigger than `1e18`, will make [`accrueInterest()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital/blob/main/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L155) always underflow, DoSing the lending pool functions that depend on the [`accrue()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital/blob/main/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L55) modifier. It should ideally be capped at a lower value, but this is more of a centralization risk.

## [L - 03] missing a way to remove `collTokens` from `Config.sol`, which could be dangerous in the long run as some token could go rogue (or an upgrade).

## [L - 04] `setBorrFactors_e18()` could check for duplicate `_pools` as an additional check to make sure that no incorrect factors are set. If 2 duplicates are sent, only the latter will take effect, which could have very dangerous implications.
